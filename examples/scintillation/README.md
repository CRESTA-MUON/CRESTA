# Beginning of a scintillator tutorial. The PhotonSD detectors have a manually process hits, which when coupled with the OpticalStepping action, should lead to something that saves hit positions.
# Very preliminary though.

# Changing the vis options is also advisable so that optical photons are drawn as simple semi transparent smooth lines.
